## ðŸ§  DSA Concepts Used

This project uses fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to simulate and solve a real-world problem of travel optimization.

| DSA Concept            | How It's Applied                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Graph (Adjacency List)** | Cities and connections (bus/flight) form a weighted graph structure              |
| **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**   | Calculates the least time travel path between source and destination cities      |
| **Priority Queue (Simulated)** | Optimized selection of the next node with the least distance (manually implemented) |
| **Greedy Algorithm**        | Chooses the optimal path step by step (Dijkstra is greedy-based)               |
| **Conditional Edge Weighting** | Flights are considered only if they reduce the total travel time             |
| **Random Graph Generation** | New graphs are generated dynamically with random cities and routes            |

âœ… Red Edges: **Bus Routes** (longer but cheaper)  
âœ… Green Edges: **Flight Routes** (shorter but limited)  
âœ… Directional arrows indicate travel path
